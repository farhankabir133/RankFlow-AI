**RankFlow AI** is an advanced, AI-powered intelligent Learning Operating System designed specifically for competitive exam seekers, university aspirants, and job candidates in Bangladesh. Powered by React 19, Tailwind v4, Express Node.js, and Google's multi-modal Gemini API, it provides real-time rank simulations, personalized guidance, and persistent preparation metrics.

This platform re-imagines competitive learning from the ground up, delivering deep analytics, spaced-repetition revisions, and written answer evaluations instead of generic quiz pages.

## 🔍 Overview

Historically, candidates preparing for high-stakes examinations in Bangladesh (such as the **BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service)**, **University Admissions**, and bank recruitments) have relied on bulky paper question banks, rigid offline coaching centers, and unautomated evaluation. These structures offer zero individual analytics, lack personalized correction, and fail to track individual subject retention over time.

**RankFlow AI** steps in to solve these deficits by functioning as a complete **personal learning operating system**:
* **Predictive Competency Engine:** Analyzes speed, raw accuracy, and topic strengths across standard practice exams to project real-time competitive ranks.
* **Bangla AI Tutor Integration:** Leverages Gemini to give instant, context-aware translations, sub-topic deep dives, and grammatical logic explained entirely in clean Bengali.
* **Memory & Spaced Repetition Rails:** Helps prevent memory decay with active-recall flashcard setups tailored to high-density syllabus areas.
* **Handwritten/Written estimation:** Estimates exam readiness for non-MCQ structured written parts utilizing multi-modal vision prompts.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment

RankFlow AI uses environment variables for secure server operations. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by mirroring `.env.example`:

```bash
# Duplicate the example config file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the newly created `.env` file and configure these variables:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key - Retrieve this directly from Google AI Studio
# Crucial: Must be kept server-side to hide it from the frontend client console.
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyYourGeminiApiKeyHere"

# App Deployment Host URL - Injected dynamically on hosting setups.
# Used for OAuth loops, reverse-proxies, and target headers.
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

---

## 📦 Installation & Setup

Ensure you have **Node.js LTS (v18 or higher)** installed on your machine.

### 1. Position into directory & install packages
```bash
# Clone or move into the repository root
cd rankflow-ai

# Fetch and install required server/client packages
npm install
```

### 2. Prepare the database & secure rules
Set up your Firebase project from your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and update `firebase-applet-config.json` with your real keys. Then deploy your rules:
```bash
# Generates and persists the firestore security rules
npm run deploy-firebase-rules
```

### 3. Launch the development environment
Start the server in development mode. The custom Express back-end intercepts request APIs while hosting hot-reloading Vite assets in the background.
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🚀 Enterprise Architecture

RankFlow AI has been built from the ground up for high-performance production workloads.

### Server Compilation System
Vite serves assets in development, but the production build pipeline is compiled cleanly into a single unified output pattern.
* **Vite Static Bundling:** Client JavaScript and CSS variables are bundled on target builds into high-efficiency chunks inside `dist/`.
* **esbuild Server Bundling:** The main `server.ts` file is compiled to `dist/server.cjs` using esbuild:
  ```bash
  esbuild server.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=cjs --packages=external --sourcemap --outfile=dist/server.cjs
  ```
* **Why CJS bundling?** Packaging `server.ts` down to a single `.cjs` file completely avoids Node's runtime ES Module resolution loops while maintaining clean backtracks through sourcemaps. This reduces container cold-start times inside serverless ecosystems.

## 🛡️ Offline Sandbox Mode

To cater to developers running the application locally without active Google Workspace accounts or Firebase OAuth configurations, **RankFlow AI** features a **Full Guest Sandbox Mode**:
* **Zero Firebase Blockers:** If Email/Password registration returns `auth/operation-not-allowed` (due to disabled services in a console), the UI guides the user on how to enable them or offers a **Guest Practice Bypass**.
* **Local Storage Persistence:** Enables complete local simulation of persistent data models using the browser's `localStorage` state engine. Everything—from mock exam scores to profile identity updates—stores locally on your device without breaking.
* **Local Document Downloads:** If Google Drive exports error out, clicking **"টেক্সট ফাইল (.txt) ডাউনলোড করুন"** directly compiles and downloads a structured question sheet with step-by-step explanations straight to your local PC.
